  abstract = {A recent breakthrough in differential network (DN) analysis of microbiome data has been realized with the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies. The DN analysis disentangles the microbial co-abundance among taxa by comparing the network properties between two or more graphs under different biological conditions. However, the existing methods to the DN analysis for microbiome data do not adjust for other clinical differences between subjects. We propose a Statistical Approach via Pseudo-value Information and Estimation for Differential Network Analysis (SOHPIE-DNA) that incorporates additional covariates such as continuous age and categorical BMI. SOHPIE-DNA is a regression technique adopting jackknife pseudo-values that can be implemented readily for the analysis. We demonstrate through simulations that SOHPIE-DNA consistently reaches higher recall and F1-score, while maintaining similar precision and accuracy to existing methods (NetCoMi and MDiNE). Lastly, we apply SOHPIE-DNA on two real datasets from the American Gut Project and the Diet Exchange Study to showcase the utility. The analysis of the Diet Exchange Study is to showcase that SOHPIE-DNA can also be used to incorporate the temporal change of connectivity of taxa with the inclusion of additional covariates. As a result, our method has found taxa that are related to the prevention of intestinal inflammation and severity of fatigue in advanced metastatic cancer patients.},

  abstract = {Background Universal provision of iron supplements or iron-containing multiple micronutrient powders (MNPs) is widely used to prevent anemia in young children in low- and middle-income countries. The BRISC (Benefits and Risks of Iron Interventions in Children) trial compared iron supplements and MNPs with placebo in children {$<$}2 y old in rural Bangladesh. Objectives We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of iron supplements or iron-containing MNPs among young children in rural Bangladesh. Methods We did a cost-effectiveness analysis of MNPs and iron supplements using the BRISC trial outcomes and resource use data, and programmatic data from the literature. Health care costs were assessed from a health system perspective. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in terms of US\$ per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. To explore uncertainty, we constructed cost-effectiveness acceptability curves using bootstrapped data over a range of cost-effectiveness thresholds. One- and 2-way sensitivity analyses tested the impact of varying key parameter values on our results. Results Provision of MNPs was estimated to avert 0.0031 (95\% CI: 0.0022, 0.0041) DALYs/child, whereas iron supplements averted 0.0039 (95\% CI: 0.0030, 0.0048) DALYs/child, over 1 y compared with no intervention. Incremental mean costs were \$0.75 (95\% CI: 0.73, 0.77) for MNPs compared with no intervention and \$0.64 (\$0.62, \$0.67) for iron supplements compared with no intervention. Iron supplementation dominated MNPs because it was cheaper and averted more DALYs. Iron supplementation had an ICER of \$1645 (\$1333, \$2153) per DALY averted compared with no intervention, and had a 0\% probability of being the optimal strategy at cost-effectiveness thresholds of \$200 (reflecting health opportunity costs in Bangladesh) and \$985 [half of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita] per DALY averted. Scenario and sensitivity analyses supported the base case findings. Conclusions These findings do not support universal iron supplementation or micronutrient powders as a cost-effective intervention for young children in rural Bangladesh., This trial was registered at anzctr.org.au as ACTRN1261700066038 and trialsearch.who.int as U1111-1196-1125.},

  abstract = {Our knowledge on species and function composition of the human gut microbiome is rapidly increasing, but it is still based on very few cohorts and little is known about their variation across the world. Combining 22 newly sequenced fecal metagenomes of individuals from 4 countries with previously published datasets, we identified three robust clusters (enterotypes hereafter) that are not nation or continent-specific. We confirmed the enterotypes also in two published, larger cohorts suggesting that intestinal microbiota variation is generally stratified, not continuous. This further indicates the existence of a limited number of well-balanced host-microbial symbiotic states that might respond differently to diet and drug intake. The enterotypes are mostly driven by species composition, but abundant molecular functions are not necessarily provided by abundant species, highlighting the importance of a functional analysis for a community understanding. While individual host properties such as body mass index, age, or gender cannot explain the observed enterotypes, data-driven marker genes or functional modules can be identified for each},

  abstract = {We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},
